# FavDish-App
The Application starts with a splash screen in which I have added animation. After landing on main activity, there are three fragments that are shown via bottom navigation - all dishes, fav dishes, random dish. Inside all dishes fragment I have added menu options for filtering and adding new dishes. The image of dish is shown with their title and a menu allowing user to edit the detailsof dish or delete the dish. Whenever user presses the dish he can see the details of the dish and share it to his other social media platform by using share menu provided at top. Also a floating button is given on the dish so that the user can mark that dish as favourite. the favourite dish can now be seen in fav dish fragment as well. From fav dish fragment the user can at any time unfavourise the dish. In the random dish user gets to see any random dish via api call. Also i have added swipe down to refresh which would refresh random dish and a new dish can be seen now. Here also the option to favourise the dish is present.once the user favourises the dish the dish is stored in his local database and can be seen in all dishes and fav dish fragment.
